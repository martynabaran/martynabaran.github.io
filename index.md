## Something about me 
I am a 18-years-old girl who's currently studying Iformatics an Intelligent Systems at the AGH University in Cracow. I am a huge fun of music, especially jazz. For 8 years now I heve been attending dance classes and this sport is the most importatnt thing to me. What is more, I love reading! Unfortunately, I don't have eough time for it these days, because of the amount of homework i have. This year i have also joined AGH Space System Team and i hope it is gonna be one of the best adventures during my studies.

  ## In the future...
What will the future bring? No one knows. But my plans are to pass this semester and learn how to code.

Stay tuned! Maybe our game will enter the market and sooner or later we'll become millionaires.
